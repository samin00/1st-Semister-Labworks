I Just want to help other students to make their lab report done in time so I have written this code. They are tested . 100% correct
--------
Section - 1
(Introduction, Constant, Variables, Data Types, Operators, Expressions, Decisions
Making,Branching and Looping)
```
(a) Write a program to find the area of a circle. (Use  as a symbolic constant).<br/>
(b) Write a program to convert the given temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa.<br/>
(c) Write a program to find the all-possible of a quadratic equation.<br/>
(d) Write a program that takes a floating-point number as input and display the floating point<br/>
and integer part separately.<br/>
(e) Write a program to find the factorial of an integer.<br/>
(f) Write a program that takes an integer as input and display it in reverse order.<br/>
(g) Write a program to convert any integer to its binary equivalent.<br/>
(h) Write a program in C to determine and print the sum of the following harmonic series for a<br/>
given value of n : s = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 ........ + 1/n.<br/>
(i) Given an integer number, write a program that displays the number as follows :<br/>
First Line : all digits<br/>
Second Line : all excepts first digits<br/>
Third Line : all excepts first two digits<br/>
...........
Last Line : the last digit.<br/>
For example, the number 5678 will be displayed as :<br/>
5 6 7 8<br/>
6 7 8<br/>
7 8<br/>
8<br/>
(j) Write a program in C that prints the largest of the three number using nesting if-else<br/>
statements.<br/>
(k) Write a program in C to compote the sum of the digits of a given integer number. For<br/>
example, the input number 123 then output should be 6.<br/>

```
Section – 2<br/>
(Arrays, Character Arrays, Strings, User-Defined Functions and Structures)<br/>
```
(a) Write a program to calculate the standard deviation for n items.<br/>
(b) Write a program to initialize all the diagonal elements of a two-dimensional array to 1 and<br/>
others to 0.
(c) Write a program that reads a string from keyboard and determines whether it is a palindrome<br/>
or not.<br/>
(d) Write a program to evaluate the expression using user defined function :<br/>
f(x) = xx^3 /3! + x^5 /5!x^7 /7!+.....<br/>
(e) Write a program to find the first n Fibonacci numbers.<br/>
(f) Write a program using an array of structure to read the number of three subjects for n<br/>
students and sort them according to their position. (1st, 2nd, 3rd ......)<br/>


(g) Given two one-dimensional arrays A and B which are sorted in ascending order. Write a<br/>
program to merge them into a single sorted array C that contains every items from arrays A<br/>
and B, in ascending order.<br/>
(h) Write a program to copy one string into another and count the number of characters copied.<br/>
(i) Write a program in C to concatenate the three arrays namely first-name, second-name, third-<br/>
name into one string to be called name.<br/>

```
Section – 3<br/>
(Pointers and File Management)<br/>
```
(a) Write a program using to pointers to read in an array of integers and print its elements in<br/>
reverse order.<br/>
(b) Write a program using printers to compute the sum of all elements stored in an array.<br/>
(c) Write a program to copy the contents of one file into another.<br/>
(d) Write a program to read data from keyboard, write it to a file called, INPUT, again read the<br/>
same data from the INPUT file and display it on the screen.<br/>
(e) Write a program that appends one file at the end of another.<br/>
(f) Write a program to open a file named INVENTORY and store in it the following data :<br/>
Item Name Number Price Quantity<br/>
AAA- 1 123 15.55 150<br/>
BBB- 2 125 36.12 175<br/>
CCC- 3 527 32.15 115<br/>
Extend the program to read this data from the file INVENTORY and display the inventory<br/>
table with the value of each item.<br/>
