I Just want to help other students to make their lab report done in time so I have written this code. They are tested . 100% correct
--------
Section - 1
(Introduction, Constant, Variables, Data Types, Operators, Expressions, Decisions
Making,Branching and Looping)
```
(a) Write a program to find the area of a circle. (Use  as a symbolic constant).
(b) Write a program to convert the given temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa.
(c) Write a program to find the all-possible of a quadratic equation.<br/>
(d) Write a program that takes a floating-point number as input and display the floating point
and integer part separately.
(e) Write a program to find the factorial of an integer.
(f) Write a program that takes an integer as input and display it in reverse order.
(g) Write a program to convert any integer to its binary equivalent.
(h) Write a program in C to determine and print the sum of the following harmonic series for a
given value of n : s = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 ........ + 1/n.
(i) Given an integer number, write a program that displays the number as follows :
First Line : all digits
Second Line : all excepts first digits
Third Line : all excepts first two digits
...........
Last Line : the last digit
For example, the number 5678 will be displayed as :
5 6 7 8
6 7 8
7 8
8
(j) Write a program in C that prints the largest of the three number using nesting if-else
statements.
(k) Write a program in C to compote the sum of the digits of a given integer number. For
example, the input number 123 then output should be 6.

```
Section – 2
(Arrays, Character Arrays, Strings, User-Defined Functions and Structures)
```
(a) Write a program to calculate the standard deviation for n items.
(b) Write a program to initialize all the diagonal elements of a two-dimensional array to 1 and
others to 0.
(c) Write a program that reads a string from keyboard and determines whether it is a palindrome
or not.
(d) Write a program to evaluate the expression using user defined function 
f(x) = xx^3 /3! + x^5 /5!x^7 /7!+.....
(e) Write a program to find the first n Fibonacci numbers.
(f) Write a program using an array of structure to read the number of three subjects for n
students and sort them according to their position. (1st, 2nd, 3rd ......)


(g) Given two one-dimensional arrays A and B which are sorted in ascending order. Write a
program to merge them into a single sorted array C that contains every items from arrays A
and B, in ascending order.<br/>
(h) Write a program to copy one string into another and count the number of characters copied.
(i) Write a program in C to concatenate the three arrays namely first-name, second-name, third-
name into one string to be called name.<br/>

```
Section – 3
(Pointers and File Management)
```
(a) Write a program using to pointers to read in an array of integers and print its elements in
reverse order.
(b) Write a program using printers to compute the sum of all elements stored in an array.
(c) Write a program to copy the contents of one file into another.
(d) Write a program to read data from keyboard, write it to a file called, INPUT, again read the
same data from the INPUT file and display it on the screen.
(e) Write a program that appends one file at the end of another.
(f) Write a program to open a file named INVENTORY and store in it the following data :
Item Name Number Price Quantity
AAA- 1 123 15.55 150
BBB- 2 125 36.12 175
CCC- 3 527 32.15 115
Extend the program to read this data from the file INVENTORY and display the inventory
table with the value of each item.
